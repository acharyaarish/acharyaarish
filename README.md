# Arish Acharya - Data Analyst

## About Me

üëã Hi, I'm Arish! I crack numbers better than jokes, but I promise both are worth a try.

üöÄ Whether I'm predicting trends, optimizing operations, or just trying to make my code run without errors, I'm all about finding innovative solutions to everyday problems.

üêç Python is my second language, and I'm proficient in several others from R to SQL. I'm constantly learning and love to play around with new technologies ‚Äì if it‚Äôs new and nerdy, I‚Äôm on it.

üîç On my GitHub, you'll find projects ranging from a home-made security system (built to keep my snacks safe) to professional dashboards analyzing everything from sales to wildlife incidents.

üí° I believe that a good laugh and a good log file can solve half of life's problems. Looking to collaborate, innovate, or just have a good tech talk? Hit me up!
