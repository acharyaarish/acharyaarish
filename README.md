# 👋 Hey, I'm **Arish**  

**💻 Full Stack Developer | UI & Data Enthusiast**  

---

I’ve been working in IT since a young age, solving problems and helping people along the way. This GitHub is my playground for learning and fun projects outside of work!  

I love building cool **UIs**, exploring **frontend development**, and diving into **data analytics**. My toolkit includes **AWS**, **Python**, **SQL**, **React**, and **Firebase**, and I’m always up for learning something new.
